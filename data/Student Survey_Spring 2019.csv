What I mean by that was there wasn't a ton of meetings, extra written requirements, etc., and the ones that did exist felt valuable and necessary. You guys have really figured out a way to support projects without being overly burdensome. ","The project management tracker - I think it's a valuable resource but how helpful it will be varies on the project. It would be especially helpful for those who may be new to ""contracting"" or working short term projects, that way everyone can be on the same page about a deliverable, expectation, etc. ",A lot,Internet research,,Yes,"I know we've talked about this a little bit before and there's a logistical challenge to it, but if at any point you're able to extend CONNECT participation to the UTHealth School of Public Health, there are a TON of student who would not only be interested but well-equipped to work on these projects. (Classes like Intervention Mapping, Program Evaluation and Building a Needs Assessment are required.) If I can help connect you (ha!) in any way with UTHealth, let me know."

I strengthened my skills in Tableau, Stata, Excel, and Piktochart through my work. I also employed a variety of quantitative data analysis skills. So, the project being focused on data analysis and visualization was a great way for me to exercise my knowledge. ","Make sure the project timeline and deliverables are as established pre-launch as possible. I was able to create visualizations, maps, analysis, etc. but much of the project is spilling into the summer. If I had only worked on the project for one semester, I would not have accomplished a lot on the to do list. ",A great deal,"Client support and instruction,Internet research,Other",Support from Alyssa,Yes,"The CONNECT program is a wonderful opportunity to LBJ students to apply and develop their skills and knowledge. My experience definitely improved my data analysis and visualization skills, and the project was instrumental in helping me find a long-term job after graduation. Given the short timeline of the project (one semester), the timing and planning should be tighter to ensure that student consultants can deliver as much as possible. Overall, I had a great experience. "
