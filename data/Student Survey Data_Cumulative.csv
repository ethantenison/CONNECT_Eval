I would love to see the CONNECT program expand to every doctoral program at UT as part of the graduation requirements; academia should be more active in the community since academic scholars have valuable research experience and skills that could positively impact the communities around them.

Everyone on the team was great and easy to work with, but they might need to better define the project and have an actual plan before they bring on another Connect student. ",Equals expectations,"The experience in the spring far exceeded my expectations but the experience in the summer fell short of expectations. Overall, I developed great consulting skills, improved my data analysis/visualization skills, and learned more about digital inclusion and city government. Having the opportunity to develop my skills in Excel, Stata, Piktochart, and Tableau were instrumental in my own professional development. ","I would be tempted to suggest that partner organizations should have a structured plan/timeline for the project before they receive a Connect student, but that would be unrealistic. I legitimately believe that John and Jesse could not have predicted that the purposive sample was going to go off the rails at the beginning of the summer. More regular in-person check-ins with the project mentor (Alyssa) and the host organization maybe would have kept things more on track. ",A great deal,Program mentors,,Yes,"Even though this summer didn't go as planned, the entire Connect experience was invaluable for building my resume and professional skills.

You guys have really figured out a way to support projects without being overly burdensome.
