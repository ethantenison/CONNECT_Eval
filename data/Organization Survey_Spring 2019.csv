Foundation Communities,CONNECT,Exceeds expectations,Extremely useful,Extremely satisfied,"Kat Sisler worked diligently on our Health Food Pantry Evaluation, selecting an appropriate surveying tool and conducting on-site, observational research for our department. We intend to implement Kat's recommendations as well as connect with an outside agency (recommended by Kat) in the fall of 2019 for further guidance on improving our healthy food pantries.  ",Kat's work highlighted some areas for improvement as well as introduced us to a vetted pantry survey tool that proved extremely useful. We intend to continue using it periodically. ,About right,Everything was fantastic! Alyssa did a wonderful job coordinating the internship and liaising with Kat and Foundation Communities on the behalf of RGK. Extremely high caliber and talented graduate student. Our entire department was very pleased/impressed and we look forward to working with CONNECT again. ,Yes,,Extremely effective,Extremely effective,Extremely effective,Extremely effective,"I know that feedback can be extremely helpful, but - honestly - everything was stellar. Sorry we couldn't be of more help in this regard...",Yes,A big thank you for a very successful semester!
Capital IDEA ,CONNECT,Equals expectations,Very useful,Extremely satisfied,We will build upon the work of our consultants by refining the questions on our survey which will help perfect our algorithm on student risks. ,"We learned that some of the questions we asked in our survey were repetitive of others or weren't specific enough. We also learned that all in all, the questions we are asking our students are the right ones and should yield the results we want through the algorithm being built. ",About right,I can't think of anything. It was a great experience for us - the communication was excellent and the end product met our expectations. ,Yes,,Very effective,Very effective,Extremely effective,Very effective,"My one piece of advice is to remember that the nonprofits don't have the knowledge they do, so we may require more explanation to full understand all the information being presented. ",Yes,Alyssa is great and coordinating everything. She made the process so easy for us. 
City of Austin,CONNECT,Equals expectations,Slightly useful,Slightly satisfied,We will use the work as a learning experience to better inform how we include interns and temporary employees.,How to better communicate when there is an intermediary involved.,About right,"I think that being able to look at an individuals work or meet them in person to gauge their interest or expertise before committing to take them on as an intern would be helpful. This process can identify what strengths and commitments a student has, a better fit them to the project. Also figuring out a way to track and hold individuals accountable to a certain amount of time worked, i.e. setting a baseline so there's more accountability.",Maybe,Issue with a lack of a back button to go back an reread the previous questions.,Slightly effective,Moderately effective,Not effective at all,Slightly effective,Take more initiative and honor the amount of time that you have agreed to commit.,No,"This may redundant since pay will now be coming from the organization in charge of the work, but there was some difficulty in enforcing the amount of time/work done by the student. From what I could tell this was an issue for two reasons, one being that there was no direct minimum time requirement and the second being that pay was coming from an outside funder. "
PelotonU,CONNECT,Exceeds expectations,Very useful,Very satisfied,"We'll use it to pilot some structured data collection within the data notes, and then do another round of Connect in the fall to build a Google Sheets test template before moving over to Salesforce",A very unintended but net-positive consequence: it uncovered a major deficiency in one of our coaches' skills regarding case notes and data. The project also helped clarify patterns for us in types of data so we can more efficiently leverage our coaches time to support students. ,About right,I'm looking forward to playing a larger role in the next round!,Yes,,Moderately effective,Moderately effective,Very effective,Very effective,"I'm reluctant even to rate since Semonti really ran point on my behalf, so I'd defer to her ratings here. ",Yes,"Excited for you to be at RGK, Alyssa!!!"
Creative Action,CONNECT,Exceeds expectations,Very useful,Extremely satisfied,This project has taken us one step further in using valuable and efficient tools to help us assess program quality. Our next step is to implement this new quick observation tool over the summer and then more fully integrate it into our assessment process.,"It's nice to hear that we are on track with our wishes and dreams--the validation for non-data program leaders is highly appreciated. It also has helped me be realistic about the timeline for creating, vetting, implementing and assessing our tools, and help break down these iterative processes more realistically.",About right,"I felt pretty confident in the scope and intentional purpose to my proposed project, but I imagine other orgs could benefit from some additional guidance in what is reasonable for the scope of the hours. I certainly could have layered in lots of ideas and possibilities, and I had to ensure I was staying focused on the most important part of the project.",Yes,,Extremely effective,Extremely effective,Very effective,Extremely effective,"Just helping keep the scope of the project on track, in case folks like me have lots of ideas and could potentially stray from the intent or try to include too many deliverables.",Yes,"It was a great partnership, and also helped give me a better framework for any time of internship model, realistic scope of work, and ways of articulating a clear work project for my own future staff or other cross-departmental work. Thank you for the opportunity!"
ServeAustin Collaborative,CONNECT,Exceeds expectations,Extremely useful,Very satisfied,"The work that our consultant did gives us some foundational/baseline data to work from as we launch multiple pilot initiatives.  And, it gave us a platform from which to apply for additional funding to get evaluation infrastructure in place.  As an un-staffed collaborative of 8 partner organizations, there was no one who had time (or expertise?) to do the work our consultant did and so it is hugely helpful!","Having a consultant look at the state of our data, help us pull what we could from it, and think about next steps was incredibly helpful and shined a light on places where we need more work and support.",About right,"I've discussed much of this with Alyssa, and I'm not sure if I can ""re-capture"" some of that thinking here.  I think it's an outstanding program that has the potential to add real value to Austin's nonprofit community given how many orgs struggle with resourcing evaluation despite how critical data is to planning and to understanding impact.  The kinds of suggestions I would offer would be tweaks around the edges - this was rock solid out of the gate.",Yes,,Very effective,Very effective,Very effective,Extremely effective,"I'd encourage him to work a bit more on communication.  His work was outstanding, but sometimes it was hard to see that right up front because of his infrequent written communication and somewhat reserved in person communication. He was the opposite of the Texas expression ""all hat, no cattle"" - he was ""all cattle,  no hat.""  While I actually prefer working with people who are less about self-promotion and more about effectiveness, his ability to be slightly more self-promoting would make his effectiveness more immediately visible to partners.  He really did outstanding and helpful work for us, especially since our data situation is awfully messy right now.",Yes,"Alyssa was just wonderful to work with.  She was communicative, on point, supportive, curious, and open.  She was great at nudging us to stay on track, asking important questions, and suggesting additional resources, ideas, and connects.  I loved having the chance to work with her and I""m sure the role she played helped us get as much as possible out of this experience."
