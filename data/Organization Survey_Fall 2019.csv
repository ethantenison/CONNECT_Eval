Upper Ninety,CONNECT,Exceeds expectations,Very useful,Very satisfied,We plan to participate in CONNECT in the coming semester with a new consultant in order to analyze the survey data that we collected through the work of our first CONNECT consultant. ,"It is important for both parties (org and consultant) to remain flexible in the work plan and deliverables, as things can easily and dramatically change. For example, we were unable to retrieve some of the data sets that we needed in order for our consultant to complete one of her deliverables. Luckily, she was very flexible and agreed to shift her focus to another (new) deliverable.

Given that no one on our small staff has a background in data, it was very helpful for our consultant to take more of a guiding role for us as we tried to make decisions about how to approach different problems.",About right,"I think the work plan/deliverable organization should be the responsibility of the consultant.

This is the first map of its kind in Guatemala and proves to be incredibly necessary. ",We learned a lot from both of our consultants this term.

Westcave Outdor Discovery Center,CONNECT,Equals expectations,Moderately useful,Moderately satisfied,We are updating our evaluation tools and planning to develop a structure that will assist us in using a consistent set of evaluation tools.,Our consultant suggested several adjustments to our evaluations. It was helpful to see what adjustments she was suggesting and her rationales for making the changes. ,Slightly too little,We feel that the program needs to add ongoing meetings between the organization and the consultant. We have also worked with the Graduate Fellows program at the McCombs School of Business which includes monthly meetings between the Fellows and the organization. Those meetings have a big impact on the depth the consultants were able to go on their assigned project.  ,Yes,,Very effective,Moderately effective,Very effective,Very effective,"Our consultant did a fine job fulfilling her project within the CONNECT program. While we would have gone farther if we had held some additional meetings, that was not a part of the CONNECT program and it also was not something that Westcave proposed to her.

Leadership Austin ,CONNECT,Exceeds expectations,Very useful,Very satisfied,"The surveys that Marjorie assisted in building will influence the direction of the 2021 Essential cohort, which focuses on leadership and civic engagement among established leaders. Her work will also be used to shape the survey process for our rising leaders program called Emerge. ","This program taught us to be more clear on how we define/measure success for our program and participants. We also learned the value of asking questions and acquiring feedback that we KNOW we will use. Too often we create surveys that ask good questions that do little to advance our program goals. Lastly, I learned that it is okay to course correct when needed. Initially, we were steadfast on creating pre, daily, mid and post year surveys. However, after chatting with Marjorie we realized that we should post-pone the mid year survey and focus on modifying both the pre and post year surveys for the 2021 cohort. It is still a work in progress but we are almost finished with the product. 

On a personal level, I learned about what works and doesn't work for me as as a supervisor.My preference is to work with an intern or employee who takes initiative and can ebb and flow with the different demands of a small, understaffed non-profit. I also developed more empathy. It was important to let Marjorie and Katherine (second intern) know that it is okay to bring their lives into the work place. So, we dealt with school needs, illnesses, changes in schedules and changes in program goals as those issues arose. Most importantly, I learned to delegate tasks better (still a work in progress!) ",About right,I don't think I have suggestions for the program. I actually ,Yes,,Moderately effective,Very effective,Moderately effective,Very effective,"The areas that were marked as moderately effective have more to do with me as a supervisor. The consultant is only as effective as the program lead. I was still figuring out what success looked like for the program and this may have slowed down our process. I also discovered that the building of the surveys required more time, which exceeded Marjorie's hours. Together, we decided that it was better to not force this process for the sake of meeting a previous deadline. Overall, I am happy with Marjorie's input and leadership. I don't know that I would change much about the process. It was a learning experience for both of us. Thank you! ",Yes,"I am pretty sure I didn't complete my thoughts on a question from the previous page, but I cannot go back to edit. Apologies!! "
